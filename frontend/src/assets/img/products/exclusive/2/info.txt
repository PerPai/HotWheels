RLC Exclusive Honda S2000

$25.00

On March 23, 2021 we lost one of the guiding lights of the Hot Wheels design team. Ryu Asada was infectiously positive, genuinely kind, and lit up every room he entered. His creations for Hot Wheels collectors are some of the finest we’ve ever cast, and he inspires us to this very day.
His bright and loving soul was represented in his beloved bright yellow Honda S2000 that he drove almost every day. In his honor, we created a version in 1:64 scale for fans of Ryu Asada and Hot Wheels.
Through this car and the specially designed package, Ryu Asada’s memory will live forever.
